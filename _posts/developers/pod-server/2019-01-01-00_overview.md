# Running your own Solid server
A Solid server allows you to register for aÂ Pod and a WebID.
<br>
You can either [use a publicly available server](/users/get-a-pod)
or follow the steps on this page to set up your own.

The following **open-source servers** are available:
* [Community Solid Server](https://github.com/CommunitySolidServer/CommunitySolidServer/) for Node.js
* [Node Solid Server](https://github.com/solid/node-solid-server) for Node.js
* [solid-nextcloud](https://github.com/pdsinterop/solid-nextcloud) as a plugin for Nextcloud
* [PHP Solid Server](https://github.com/pdsinterop/php-solid-server) for PHP

We walk you through the [installation of the Community Solid Server](/self-hosting/css).
<br>
We also provide [Instructions for Node Solid Server](/self-hosting/nss).
